based on sigma2, mixing is still not great, but does seem to give stable values

now using a final thin of 8 (in combine_runs.R) to get from 2000 to 500 samples, as o.w. would have 16 GB output file

results sent to Charlie are /var/tmp/paleon/composition-eastern-moretaxa/output/PLScomposition_eastern_2073-42_0.2.nc derived from PLScomposition_eastern_0.2-{1..10}_full.nc

got new dataset from Charlie a couple weeks ago (2073-42)

ran 10 runs on Savio (savio2) for 150k iterations; took about 11 days, plus a day or two to generate probabilities

2022-08-25: ran 4 runs for 150k iterations; took about a week on scf-sm2 nodes.
I left out beech and sugar maple so need to rerun.

mixing of sigma2 not very good for some taxa, in particular cedar, fir, hard_pitc, white birch, yellow birch. Doesn't seem directly correlated with sample size. Does seem associated with higher sigma2 values, so more smooth surfaces, perhaps not surprisingly.

Looks like I should remove 100 out of 300 iterations (50k out of 150k before thinning) and probably do 10 runs.

Runs take about 7 days on high partition with another 2 days for props sample generation.
